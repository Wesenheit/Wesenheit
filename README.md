### Hello! :wave:
I'm a 4th year student at the Astronomical Observatory, Warsaw University. Currently working at the intersection of Astronomy and Machine Learning. I especially like to work within the Bayesian framework and use complex generative models
like Normalizing Flows and Variational Autoencoders in the field of Natural Sciences.
