### Hello! :wave:
I'm a 3rd year student at the Astronomical Observatory, Warsaw University. Currently working under supervision of dr. Przymysław Mróz looking for Dormant Black Holes in OGLE survey database. Meanwhile working with many kinds of ML models like DNN, generative modeling, probabilistic graphical modeling.
I also do a lot of different simulations mainly in the field of astrophysics but also statistical physics and more. Recently interested in ML applications in bioinformatics.
