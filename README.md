### Hello! :wave:
I'm a 5th year Master's student at the Astronomical Observatory, Warsaw University. Currently working within the field of computational astrophysics. Dedicating a half of my time to analyse the simulation data and the other half to simulate the data. Previously working in observational astrophysics.
